I like Numerical Optimization, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Image/Signal Processing.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on small implementations in C++ for Image Processing/Machine Learning, nothing unified... one-off repositories of papers that I find interesting.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Clojure and Nim:
   - Looking forward to learning FP style languages.
   - Steering away from OOP for a while.
   - With a possible interest in metaprogramming.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on audio/signal processing libraries.
