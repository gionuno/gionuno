I like:
- Numerical Optimization
- Artificial Intelligence
- Data Science/Machine Learning
- Image/Signal Processing

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Small implementations in C++ for Image Processing/Machine Learning, nothing unified... one-off repositories of papers that I find interesting.


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Clojure and Nim. Looking forward to learning FP style languages.
- Design Patterns for *serious* software development.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
- Audio/signal processing libraries.
